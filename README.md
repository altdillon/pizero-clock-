# pizero-clock-
final project for my ELEC 1520 class. 

the goal of this project was to build an internet connected alarm clock.  It proved to not be a very good idea, and didn't work super well(From a tech standpoint it works great!).
But I still got an A!  So I guess it worked out and, it's a fun project to go back and look at.  This is an interesting exsample of writing a demon/service in python and bash to interface with hardwhere.
